## BLOG FIGURES

### Class Distribution in Training and Validation Sets  
[blog_figures](/blog_figures/) 
Using our set of warbler species, `class_names`, and counts of each class' occurrences in our spectrograms, we made a two-group bar chart.  
**(X: warbler species, Y: species instances per set)**

### Training and Validation Accuracy  
[insert link to that block of code]  
Using the history of our model's training process (training accuracy and validation accuracy), we made a two-group line chart.  
**(X: epochs, Y: accuracy metric)**

### Training and Validation Loss

Using the history of our model's training process (training loss and validation loss), we made a two-group line chart.  
**(X: epochs, Y: loss metric)**

### Confusion Matrix  
[insert link to that block of code]  
Using the class names of `y_true` and `y_pred`, we made a typical confusion matrix. To plot it properly, we added a colormap, colorbar, axis ticks, colormap-dependent text, and normalized decimal values.
